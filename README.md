The code in this directory represents a [low-code](https://prismatic.io/docs/integrations/low-code-integration-designer/) integration that has been [converted](https://prismatic.io/docs/integrations/code-native/get-started/convert-low-code-code-native/) to its [code-native](https://prismatic.io/docs/integrations/code-native/) equivalent.
By converting a low-code integration to code-native, you can take advantage of the full power of TypeScript and the NPM ecosystem as you build your integration.

> Please note that conversion is a one-way operation. Once you convert a low-code integration to code-native, you cannot convert it back to low-code.

## File structure

A code-native integration is comprised of several files and directories that work together to define the integration's behavior.
Many files are autogenerated boilerplate and serve to set up the development environment:

```txt
├── 📁 assets/
│   └── icon.png       # The icon for your integration
├── jest.config.js     # Configuration for the Jest unit testing suite
├── package.json       # Standard NPM package manifest that includes @prismatic-io/spectral dependency
├── 📁 src/            # Your source code directory (see below for details)
├── tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration file
└── webpack.config.js  # Webpack configuration for compiling your TypeScript code
```

The `src` directory contains the core logic of your integration, including configuration pages and flows:

```txt
├── 📁 src/
│   ├── componentRegistry.ts  # A list components that you reference in your code
│   ├── configPages.ts        # The config wizard experience your users will see
│   ├── 📁 flows/             # Your integration's flows
│      ├── _01OnDeploy.ts     # Logic for 01 On deploy
│      ├── _011ProcessMassSyncing.ts     # Logic for 01.1 Process Mass Syncing
│      ├── _02SyncEvery2Minutes.ts     # Logic for 02 Sync every 2 minutes
│      ├── _021ProcessSyncEvery5Minutes.ts     # Logic for 02.1 Process Sync Every 5 Minutes
│      ├── _022ProcessUpsertData.ts     # Logic for 02.2 Process Upsert/Data
│   └── index.ts              # Metadata about the integration (name, description, etc.)
```

## Post-export steps

After exporting your low-code integration to code-native, there are several steps you should take to ensure that you're taking advantage of TypeScript and the NPM ecosystem, including removing unused step result assignments, simplifying branch steps, adding type annotations, and simplifying code steps.
For a detailed guide on these steps, please refer to the [post-export steps documentation](https://prismatic.io/docs/integrations/code-native/get-started/convert-low-code-code-native/#post-generation-instructions).
